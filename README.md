# This project explores the locations and timelines of the Green and Renewable Energy Projects across the Hawaiian islands using data collected from the HECO website and PUC.
# Depending on data and insight provided by UERP, this project may focus on exploring how much Maui customers specifically have paid into these projects, 
# or may deviate in another direction that will better support UERP.
